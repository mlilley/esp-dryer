# Adafruit-style Arduino library for SH1106 displays

This inherits from Adafruit_GFX libraries.
It should behave exactly like Adafruit's own Adafruit_SSD1306 I2C displays (but without SSD1306 scroll etc).

Adafruit_SH1106_kbv inherits all the methods from  
the Adafruit_GFX class: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview  
and Print class: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
products from Adafruit!

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder Adafruit_SH1106_kbv. Check that the Adafruit_SH1106_kbv folder contains Adafruit_SH1106_kbv.cpp and Adafruit_SH1106_kbv.h

Place the Adafruit_SH1106_kbv library folder your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE

Also requires the Adafruit_GFX library for Arduino.
